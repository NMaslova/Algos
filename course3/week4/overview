DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING BOOT CAMP: This week is devoted to the dynamic programming design paradigm and a selection of
killer applications: the famous Knapsack problem in Part XXVI, the sequence alignment problem in Part XXVII,
and computing optimal binary search trees in Part XXVIII.

HOMEWORK #4: The fourth problem set and programming assignment reinforce the concepts and algorithms studied in
the lectures, and the programming assignment asks you to implement a dynamic programming algorithm for the Knapsack
problem.

SUGGESTED READINGS FOR WEEK 3:

CLRS Chapter 15
DPV Chapter 6
KT Sections 6.3-6.6
