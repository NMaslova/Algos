SUMMARY: Week 1 is all about graph search and its applications (section X). We'll cover a selection of fundamental
primitives for reasoning about graphs. One very cool aspect of this material is that all of the algorithms that we'll
cover are insanely fast (linear time with small constants); and, it can be quite subtle to understand why they work!
The culmination of these lectures --- computing the strongly connected components of a directed graph with just two
passes of depth-first search --- vividly illustrates the point that fast algorithms often require deep insight
into the structure of the problem that you're solving. There are also lecture notes for this last topic (available
for download underneath the videos). (If you're feeling REALLY motivated, you might read up on Tarjan's earlier
algorithm for computing SCCs that needs only a single DFS pass!)

SUGGESTED READINGS FOR WEEK 1: Algorithms Illuminated (Part 2), Chapters 7 and 8.
